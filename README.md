# TikTakToe-React-Components
A short exercise demonstrating components and state in React

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- visual improvement; re-style the buttons to be easier on the eyes and look more professional
- stop upon game completion; prevent user input when one player has won
  - implemented by monitoring game state. When the state indicates there is a winner, disable all buttons on the board and show a button to start a new game
